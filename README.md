# An Aircraft Flight Safety System - using Ada-SPARK
This is the coursework I submitted for my 4th year 'Formal Approaches to Software Engineering' module - I received a grade (with merit) of 67.5%

This was my first time programming in Ada-SPARK

We were given a set of health & safety requirements for an aircraft e.g. "Plane can't take off unless all doors are shut and locked". With this, we were asked to create a sort of "flight simulator" using Ada-SPARK, demonstrating adherence to the safety criteria. The focus of the coursework was on the strength of the pre-conditions we defined in each procedure.
